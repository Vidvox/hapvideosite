  <h1>How Do The Hap Codecs Compare To Other Popular Formats?</h1>
    <h3>Picking the right codec for the job.</h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">Within the lifetime of a video production the actual media files being used often pass between several different formats that are best suited for the task at hand.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">For event production, digital signage, film production and other areas where HD and ultra high resolution video is being used the most commonly used formats are h.264, Pro Res and Hap.</p>
  <h2>Benchmarks</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">The two main areas where the Hap Codecs can benefit a workflow are in performance (measured in the number of concurrent movies that can be played back) and in file size (measured in mbits/sec).</p>
    <h3>View Results For: 1080 | 4k | 8k Video</h3>
  <h4>Performance</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">The Hap codecs are optimized for smooth playback of very large movie files.</p>

  <h4>File Size / Data Rate</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">The file size of media compressed often varies heavily depending on the complexity of the imagery. In this case we've compared two extreme cases, a completely blank video file and a file of complete noise, along with an average value computed by comparing a variety of different reference movies to give an idea of the expected data-rate range.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">On average file sizes for Hap and Hap Q are often comparable to Pro Res 422 – sometimes they will be bigger, sometimes smaller.<p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">For situations where an alpha channel is needed the Hap Alpha and Hap Q Alpha codecs can provide significant savings over Pro Res 4444 and similar formats, in most cases reducing the file size by at least 49% and 23% respectively.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Game and VR developers who are using sequences of raw DXT encoded frames for video can achieve significant file size savings in the range of 30-45% by using the Hap encoded video or images.</p>

  <h3>Analysis Of Results</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">h.264: Smallest file size, low to good quality, fewest number of layers, maximum specification resolution of 4k. Best for backup, basic playback, mobile device recording, streaming and other low bandwidth situations.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Pro Res 422 / 4444: Very good quality, optional alpha channel, medium to large file sizes. Best for video editing, archiving and basic high quality playback.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Hap Codecs: Optimized for real-time playback, low to good quality, optional alpha channel, medium to large file sizes. Best for smooth playback of ultra-high resolution video files and to reduce file size when an alpha channel is needed.</p>
