  <h1>Using The Hap Codecs</h1>
  <p>Movies that are encoded with the Hap codecs are exported into standard .mov or .avi containers just like other video files you are used to working with.</p>
  <h4>Playing Hap Movies</h4>
  <p>A movie file encoded in one of the Hap codecs will playback just like any other video in <a href="who-supports-hap-codecs.html">over 20 different popular applications and creative coding environments</a> on macOS, Windows and Linux, often without installing any additional software. Typically any audio tracks that are also included with the movie are played back by the host application.</p>
  <h4>Encoding Movie Files To Hap</h4>
  <p>Using the free QuickTime extension you can export to Hap directly from many existing video rendering software and batch exporting applications. This extension is often bundled in the installer for many software packages or <a href="https://github.com/Vidvox/hap-qt-codec/releases">downloaded from GitHub</a>.</p>
  <p>On the macOS there is a <a href="https://github.com/Vidvox/hap-in-avfoundation/releases">free opensource batch exporter tool from VIDVOX</a> that will encode to and from AVFoundation supported codecs.</p>
  <p>FFMPEG can be used from the commandline to encode to Hap.</p>
  <p>Some media servers provide their own tools for transcoding movies into Hap for their platforms.</p>
  <h4>Choosing The Right Codec For The Job: Hap, Hap Alpha, Hap Q and Hap Q Alpha</h4>
   <p>There are four different flavors of Hap to choose from when encoding your clips.</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Hap has the lowest data-rate and reasonable image quality.
   <li>Hap Alpha has similar image quality to Hap, and supports an Alpha channel.
   <li>Hap Q has improved image quality, at the expense of larger file sizes.
   <li>Hap Q Alpha has improved image quality and an Alpha channel, at the expense of larger file sizes.
   </ul>
   <p>Hap and Hap Alpha include an optional quality setting when encoding. Lower quality will in some cases translate to a smaller file size.</p>
   <p>Hap Q and Hap Q Alpha allow for encoding with an optional specified 'chunk' size to optimize encodings for ultra high resolution video on a particular hardware system. This setting should typically only be used if you are reaching a CPU performance bottleneck during playback. As a general guide, for HD footage or smaller you can set the chunk size to 1 and for 4k or larger footage the number of chunks should never exceed the number of CPU cores on the computer that will playback the file.</p>
