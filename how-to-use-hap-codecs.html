  <h1>Using The Hap Codecs</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Movies that are encoded with the Hap codecs are exported into standard .mov or .avi containers just like other video files you are used to working with.</p>
    <h4>Playing Hap Movies</h4>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">A movie file encoded in one of the Hap codecs will playback just like any other video in <a href="who-supports-hap-codecs.html">over 20 different popular applications and creative coding environments</a> on macOS, Windows and Linux, often without installing any additional software. Typically any audio tracks that are also included with the movie are played back by the host application.</p>
    <h4>Encoding Movie Files To Hap</h4>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">Using the free QuickTime extension you can export to Hap directly from many existing video rendering software and batch exporting applications. This extension is often bundled in the installer for many software packages or <a href="https://github.com/Vidvox/hap-qt-codec/releases">downloaded from GitHub</a>.<br>On the macOS there is a <a href="https://github.com/Vidvox/hap-in-avfoundation/releases">free opensource batch exporter tool from VIDVOX</a> that will encode to and from AVFoundation supported codecs.<br>FFMPEG can be used from the commandline to encode to Hap.<br>Some media servers provide their own tools for transcoding movies into Hap for their platforms.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">Hap Q and Hap Q Alpha allow for encoding with system specific 'chunk' size to optimize encodings for ultra high resolution video. The number of chunks should not exceed the number of CPU cores on the system that will playback the file.</p>
