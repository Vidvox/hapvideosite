  <h1>Welcome to the Official HAP Video Codecs Homepage</h1>
    <h3>The <em>Hardware Accelerated Playback</em> solution for HD and ultra high resolution video.</h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">HAP is a set of video codecs for macOS, Windows and Linux that performs decompression using a computer's graphics hardware, substantially reducing the CPU usage necessary to play video â€” this is useful in situations where CPU power is a limiting factor, such as when working with multiple high resolution videos in real-time.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">Since the initial release in 2013 the open source HAP codecs family has become the standard for high performance high resolution movie playback in the worlds most popular media servers, live video performance and mapping softwares, powering the visuals running at the worlds largest events.</p>
  <h2>An Open Standard For Creative Work</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Artists need to use their movie files in lots of different tools during the creative process. Nobody wants to be locked into a single platform and having to transcode to lots of different proprietary formats is a pain.</p>
  <h2>Widely Supported For High Performance Video Playback</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">The HAP codecs work natively in <a href="http://github.com/vidvox/hap">over 20 different applications and creative coding environments</a> on macOS, Windows and Linux.</p>
  <h2>Works with Existing Encoding and Batch Exporting Softwares</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Using the free QuickTime extension you can export to HAP directly from many existing video rendering software and batch exporting applications. This extension is often bundled in the installer for many software packages or <a href="https://github.com/Vidvox/hap-qt-codec/releases">downloaded from GitHub</a>.<br>On the macOS there is a <a href="https://github.com/Vidvox/hap-in-avfoundation/releases">free opensource batch exporter tool from VIDVOX</a> that will encode to and from AVFoundation supported codecs.<br>FFMPEG can be used from the commandline to encode to HAP.</p>
  <h2>Information For Software Developers</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Visit the official <a href="http://github.com/vidvox/hap">HAP GitHub Repository</a> for the specification description, frameworks and example code. If you are already using QuickTime, AVFoundation, FFMPEG, LibAV or DirectShow for movie playback or encoding it is relatively easy to add native support for HAP to your application.</p>
  <h2>Open Source</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">The HAP video codecs are open-source, licensed under a Free BSD License, meaning you can use it in your commercial or noncommercial applications free of charge. This project was originally written by <a href="http://kriss.cx/tom/">Tom Butterworth</a> who continues to maintain the bulk of the development and was commissioned by <a href="http://vidvox.net">VIDVOX</a> in 2012. Additional code and financial support has been provided by other developers and organizations since its initial public release in 2013.</p>
