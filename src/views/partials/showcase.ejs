    	<h2>Live visuals for Gold Panda</h2>
    	<p>“When I first built the set, 16 layers of 1920 x 1080 material running all at once, was a serious tax on my machine. I moved a lot of the existing media in to the HAP codec, this effected a huge performance gain.”<br />— Dan Tombs (Gold Panda)</p>

    	<h2>What is HAP?</h2>
    	<p>HAP is a set of video codecs for macOS, Windows and Linux that performs decompression using a computer's graphics hardware, substantially reducing the CPU usage necessary to play video. It has become the standard for high performance, high resolution movie playback on media servers, live video performance, and event visuals.</p>
